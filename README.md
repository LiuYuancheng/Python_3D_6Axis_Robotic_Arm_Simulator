# Python_3D_6Axis_Robotic_Arm_Simulator

**Program Design Purpose** : We want to create a PLC controlled robot arm simulation system with the OPCUA-TCP communication interface. The simulator system can be used as a cyber twin for robot arm control and OT security training.  This module is a simple simulator for a robotic arm by using the wxPython and OpenGL library.
